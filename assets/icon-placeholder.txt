ICON PLACEHOLDERS

For a complete implementation, you would need to create the following icon files:

1. icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon-32.png (32x32 pixels)
3. icon-80.png (80x80 pixels)

These icons are referenced in the manifest.xml file and are used in various places in the Outlook UI.

For development purposes, you can create simple icons using any image editing software like:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free and open-source)
- Inkscape (free and open-source)
- Online tools like Canva or Figma

Icon Design Guidelines:
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use a consistent color scheme that matches your brand
- Ensure the icon is clear against both light and dark backgrounds
- Follow Microsoft's Fluent Design System for best integration with Office

Example Icon Design for Vertretungsanalyse:
- A simple "V" or "VA" monogram

Once you have created these icons, place them in the assets directory and they will be included in the build process.
